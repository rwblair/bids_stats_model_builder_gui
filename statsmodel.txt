input - limit to sub, ses, task, 
auto add level(s?). if there are runs then groupby run subject, if there are no run but sessions add sessions, if all else fails add subject
    - model x - all the predictors we have seen? auto type to GLM.
    - contrasts - list, multi select with weights...
    - dummy contrast button like neuroscout to auto create verbose contrasts

edges - leave off? one track models only?

react-jsonschema-form - in order to get the select multiple fields we want based on dataset information we'd need to modify the schema on the fly changing types to enums with the observed values.
